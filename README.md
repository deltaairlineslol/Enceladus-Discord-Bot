# Enceladus-Discord-Bot
This is a Repository where you can find how the bot works!

# How does this bot run?
This bot runs through Discord.py and Python 3.9!
I currently run this bot on my PC, because I can't afford a server.

# How Can I run this bot?
You can run this bot through your own PC/Repl by using the modules discord.py and python.
If you want to, you can also run a database for EnceBot, because as of 3/17/23, EnceBot uses a Database! It uses MongoDB, so if you know how to set that up, go right for it. There is a comment for the variable version of angerlevel, and several comments talking about how this requires a DB, and to disable it if you don't have it.

# What is the reason for having the bot be open-source?
I want you to learn from this bot if you're into learning how the bots work! And I want you to see how you could work on your own bot!
